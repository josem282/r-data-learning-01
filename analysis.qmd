title: "Exploratory Analysis of mtcars"
format: html
---

## Context

This is a small exploratory analysis using the `mtcars` dataset.
The goal is not to build a model, but to practice data exploration
and interpretation.

## Load data
```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

## Basic summary
```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Distribution of miles per gallon (mpg)
```{r}
hist(
  mtcars$mpg,
  main = "Distribution of MPG",
  xlab = "Miles per Gallon"
)
```

## Relationship between weight and mpg
```{r}
plot(
  mtcars$wt,
  mtcars$mpg,
  xlab = "Weight",
  ylab = "MPG",
  main = "MPG vs Weight"
) 
```


## Notes

- There seems to be a negative relationship between weight and MPG.

- This is a very small dataset.

- Further analysis would require assumptions and validation.
